I have no idea if my comments show or anything so i wrote a read me. The files i uploaded are for making the multiplayer work.
when you go onto the server it should just make a circle and the player can control that circle using wasd and more players can
join and control their circles but ive been working on this for a couple of days and i cant figure out why it is not working so i thought 
that maybe you guys can take a look at it.
