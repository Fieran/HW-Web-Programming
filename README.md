# HW-Web-Programming

This github is for the development of an MMOG for the Computer Systems Web Programming course at Heriot-Watt, second year. We are to create this game using Javascript, HTML and CSS, using the likes of Node to handle the player connections. Sexurity is of course also a concern.

Ross Davidsons Proposals:

Democratic Dungeons: A text based adventure in which the players in game vote on which decisions to take. A simple example would be:

"You see a house. Do you:
  a. Open the door
  b. Go around the back
  c. leave"
  
  All players would then be prompted to choose one of the options, and the overall majority wins. Some kind of tie-breaker may be needed in the event of a hard 50/50 split, and a timer to avoid idle players from stopping the progression.
  
  
Strategy RPG: This would be a simple game. Players would connect to a lobby, select a team of three units from sword, lance, axe and bow. For the base, each unit would have 5 HP.
  Sword deals 2 damage to axe and 1 to lance
  Lance deals 2 damage to sword and 1 to axe
  Axe deals 2 damage to lance and 1 to sword
  Bow deals 1 damage, but cannot counterattack and takes 2 damage from all attacks except other bows
  
 They would then go into a game map and need to defeat 1 or more opponents, before returning to the lobby.
 
 
Metroidvania like maps: Castlevania, Harmony of Despair is the inspiration here. Players would meet in a lobby, team up and tackle large maps with multiple paths possible depending upon the items chosen, fighting a boss at the end
 
  Characters would be able to choose from a thief (can lockpick), a warrior (can smash) or a mage (can teleport) to open up new paths for the team in the base.
