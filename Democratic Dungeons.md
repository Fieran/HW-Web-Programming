For this game, we will be creating a Choose your own adventure, similar in nature to the old fighting fantasy books.

For this game specifically, we will have the text broken up into brief burbs, followed by 1-4 of options. Everyone in the lobby will be able to select one of the options presented (go left, go right, pet dog, etc) to advance the adventure. The most voted for option will then occur ("You take the time to pet the dog. the dog yaps exicted and starts to dig at the ground, uncovering a huge bag of gold!") To help prevent the game stalling, a timer will end the vote after a specific amount of time. In the case of a tie, a coin toss will occur to keep the game flowing.

The game will have basic 2d graphics to represent the current location, events and other such information that can be visually shown. An inventory list is a possible addition, but for the base release we will be focusing on getting the voting system to work to allow players to get through the adventure. Or die horribly due to poor decisions.

This will mostly function through the use of Node.js, with HTML and CSS used to present the text and visuals.
